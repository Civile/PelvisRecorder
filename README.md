#When and why I had this idea?
The rarities of Eric Clapton inspired me!
I made it in less then one week! The code is not as it should be and not optimized! Indeed looks surely messy and unstable.

# Dependencies 
NuGet Visual Studio package manager: https://www.nuget.org/

Libraries: NAudio.Lame: https://github.com/Corey-M/NAudio.Lame

# Fixed bugs

3-3-2016: It has been reported to be incompatible with the version 1.0.3.101 of Spotify running on Windows 7 x64. Now Pelvis is able to record from any Spotify version
