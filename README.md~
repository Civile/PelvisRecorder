#When and why I had this idea?
So, i was trying to "find" somewhere one of my favourite songs - 'Sensitive kind by Eric Clapton' but without success. I've built this solution to solve this biiig-emotionallywasting problem in less than a week. Other online solutions were filled with viruses or incompatible with my pc.   

# Dependencies 
NuGet Visual Studio package manager: https://www.nuget.org/

Libraries: NAudio.Lame: https://github.com/Corey-M/NAudio.Lame

# Fixed bugs

3-3-2016: It has been reported to be incompatible with the version 1.0.3.101 of Spotify running on Windows 7 x64. Now Pelvis is able to record from any Spotify version
